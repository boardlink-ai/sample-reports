            <h2>Correlating School Board Conversations with National Media Coverage</h2>
            <p>We correlated our dataset with Media Matters' national news topic coverage to identify trends and influences. Key findings include:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <strong>Critical Race Theory (CRT) and Transgender Student Athletes:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Correlation:</strong> Spikes in discussions within school boards closely mirrored Media Matters' national coverage.</li>
                        <li><strong>Implications:</strong> Suggests that national news may significantly influence local school board discussions.</li>

                        <li><strong>Fox News Lag:</strong> Observed that Fox News' coverage lags behind school board activity spikes, suggesting possible other sources of influence.</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Trend Analysis:</strong> Heavy news rotation on CRT in 2021, with discussions in school boards peaking simultaneously and declining thereafter.</li>
                        <li><strong>Interpretation:</strong> National news likely drives the intensity and frequency of local discussions, rather than organic grassroots interest.</li>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Is National News Interest Impacting Efficient Resource Allocation?</strong> <br/>Time and resources are diverted to topics driven by external influences rather than pressing local concerns.<br/>
                    <ul>
                        <li><em>Example:</em> In the Lynden School District in Whatcom County, WA the topic of transgender student athlete participation was discussed extensively across half a dozen school board meetings in 2024, culminating in a letter to the state legislature on behalf of the school district. <a href="https://lynden.wednet.edu/school-board/wiaa-transgender-athlete-participation/">https://lynden.wednet.edu/school-board/wiaa-transgender-athlete-participation/</a>. 
                            
                            <p>Despite the many hours of discussion and effort producing a letter on behalf of the district, there are no known cases of transgender students participating in athletics within the school district. Instead, activity correlates heavily with national partisan discourse.

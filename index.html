    <h2>Our Dataset</h2>
  <p>During a recent data collection trial with Washington State school boards, we processed:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>17,304 Documents</strong></li>
    <li><strong>665 Meeting Recordings</strong></li>
    <li><strong>12,070 Text-Based Meeting Minutes</strong></li>
  </ul>
  <p>Below are some highlights from three sample analyses generated from the collected data and our research tools.</p>

  <h2>How Districts Are Addressing Funding Shortfalls</h2>
  <p>
    When pandemic-related federal funding ended, districts faced new budget challenges. We explored 
    the many ways large and small districts responded, including local levies, grant writing, 
    and cost-reduction strategies.

  <h2>Specific Programs Cut Due to Budget Concerns</h2>
  <p>
    In conjunction with the funding shortfall analysis, we examined recurring mentions of which 
    programs were trimmed or cut entirely. We found certain after-school activities, special 
    programs, and elective courses were often the first to go.

  <h2>Correlating Local Board Conversations with National Media Coverage</h2>
  <p>
    We cross-referenced local school board meeting topics with national news coverage to see how 
    certain phrases (e.g., <em>Critical Race Theory, Transgender Student Athletes</em>) might rise 
    and fall in tandem with media attention.

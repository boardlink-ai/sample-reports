This report summarizes notable patterns and developments in Memoranda of Understanding (MOUs) between Washington State school districts and partner institutions (primarily community and technical colleges) during the 2024–2025 academic years. Based on review of contract language, board minutes, and interlocal agreements, the following high-level trends emerged:

---

## 1. Expansion of CTE Dual Credit Programs
Many school districts—**Blaine**, **Meridian**, **Bellingham**—have expanded Career and Technical Education (CTE) dual credit opportunities. These programs allow high school students to earn college credit through articulated CTE coursework. The Whatcom CTE Dual Credit Consortium serves as a model for regional coordination.

> **Blaine School District**, *Sept 1, 2024*:  
> “CTE Dual Credit articulation agreements are designed to award college credit to students who successfully complete articulated college-level career and technical education courses.”  
> *(Whatcom County)*

## 2. Formalized Interdistrict and College Partnerships
Regional MOUs increasingly involve **multiple districts and colleges** working together to align offerings and share administrative burdens. These include large-scale consortium agreements that extend beyond single districts to serve regional needs.

> **Whatcom CTE Consortium MOU**  
> Members include Bellingham, Blaine, Ferndale, Lynden, Meridian, Mount Baker, and Nooksack districts, along with Bellingham Technical College and Whatcom Community College.

## 3. Clear Operational Standards and Credit Requirements

> **Meridian School District**, *Apr 6, 2024*:  
> “Students will receive college credit upon successful completion of the dual credit course(s) with a grade ‘B’ (3.0) or better.”  
> *(Whatcom County)*

## 4. Emphasis on Data Sharing and Evaluation
MOUs increasingly include **data-sharing provisions** to support third-party evaluations and continuous improvement. This reflects a broader push toward accountability and evidence-based refinement.

> **Kalama School District**, *Jun 30, 2024*:

> “The purpose of this agreement is to provide occupational education programs and related services to eligible high school students of the District.”  
> *(Running Start with Bellingham Technical College)*

## 8. Automatic College Admission Initiatives

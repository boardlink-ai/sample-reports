      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        A variety of school districts face the challenging task of balancing budgets amid declining enrollment, expiring grants, inflation, 
        and other constraints. These pressures have often led school boards and district leadership to propose or enact cuts to certain 
        educational programs. This document synthesizes meeting snippets with a specific focus on <em>which programs</em> are being cut.
      </p>
      <p>
        Where possible, direct quotations from public comments or board statements have been preserved, as these highlight the authenticity 
        and gravity of the cuts being made.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Common Programs -->
    <section class="section" id="common-programs">
      <h2>Commonly Affected Programs</h2>
      <p>Five primary categories of concern emerged from district meeting snippets:</p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>CTE (Career and Technical Education) Classes</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Performing &amp; Visual Arts</strong> (e.g., Culinary Arts, Drama, Music)</li>
        <li><strong>After-School &amp; Extended-Day Programs</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Specialized Intervention Programs</strong> (Tier II, Literacy, Summer School)</li>
        <li><strong>College/Career Readiness Programs</strong> (College &amp; Career Centers)</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>1. Career &amp; Technical Education (CTE)</h3>
      <blockquote class="quote">
        <p>“The administration… has several Career and Technical Education (CTE) classes that are not needed based on student forecasting 
        requests for the 2024-2025 school year… A total of 0.8 CTE classes are eliminated.”</p>
        <cite>— Battle Ground SD (05/13/24)</cite>
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote class="quote">
        <p>“Contain escalating Special Education costs… [We are] exploring CTE changes if enrollment dips further.”</p>
        <cite>— Granite Falls SD (03/13/24)</cite>
      </blockquote>
      <p><em>Key Concern</em>: Maintaining hands-on workforce preparation while facing decreased enrollment or insufficient sign-ups 
      can be difficult. Districts must weigh whether to continue specialized CTE pathways with low enrollment.</p>

      <h3>2. Performing &amp; Visual Arts</h3>
      <blockquote class="quote">
        <p>“Resolution proposes the cut of the Culinary Arts Program at West Sound Tech. Enrollment is down and because of construction, 
        there is no space right now…”</p>
        <cite>— Bremerton SD (03/21/24)</cite>
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote class="quote">
        <p>“He commented on the proposed budget reduction and asked for a more equitable division of reductions, focusing on deeper cuts 
        to administration. Another community member lamented the potential cuts to the culinary class and larger class sizes.”</p>
        <cite>— Blaine SD (04/22/24)</cite>
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote class="quote">
        <p>“There are programs available that need to be seriously looked at for retaining the theater class… ‘Proposal to eliminate the 
        drama teacher position,’ we need to think very seriously about how to keep that position.”</p>
        <cite>— Tukwila SD (05/28/24)</cite>
      </blockquote>
      <p><em>Key Concern</em>: Arts programs are beloved but often costly. Cuts risk reducing student engagement and disproportionately 
      affect students whose strengths lie in creative fields.</p>

      <h3>3. After-School &amp; Extended-Day Programs</h3>
      <blockquote class="quote">
        <p>“…the 21st Century Grant is not funded for the next school year, so we are looking at alternative before and after‐school 
        programs…”</p>
        <cite>— Tukwila SD (02/27/24)</cite>
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote class="quote">
        <p>“The board was reminded that the 21st Century before/after‐school program lost its funding and has been cancelled for 
        the 2024–2025 school year…”</p>
        <cite>— Highland SD (06/03/24)</cite>
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote class="quote">
        <p>“Students should not suffer because of the failures of adults. The budgeting issues have brought up potential sports/activities 
        cuts… We also heard from parents about possible after‐school changes if SROs also had to be cut.”</p>
        <cite>— Moses Lake SD (05/23/24; Public Comments)</cite>
      </blockquote>
      <p><em>Key Concern</em>: These programs offer critical academic, social, and childcare support. With federal grants expiring, 
      districts often cannot absorb costs in local budgets.</p>

      <h3>4. Specialized Interventions (Tier II, Literacy, Summer)</h3>
      <blockquote class="quote">
        <p>“Last week I received an email that stated because of funding my position is being cut. The district claims they want to make 
        cuts furthest away from students; however, it seems the majority of the cuts, at the elementary level, have been to staff 
        who work directly with our students.”</p>
        <cite>— Tukwila SD (05/28/24)</cite>
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote class="quote">
        <p>“Thanked board members for their work. Expressed that cutting direct services, specifically Tier II services, should be last on 
        the list.”</p>
        <cite>— Vashon Island SD (05/09/24)</cite>
      </blockquote>
      <p><em>Key Concern</em>: Interventions for literacy or social-emotional supports help the most vulnerable students. Reductions 
      risk widening achievement gaps.</p>

      <h3>5. College/Career Readiness Programs</h3>
      <blockquote class="quote">
        <p>“If we start removing this program and position, there is a chance that it is going to collapse. We absolutely need to figure 
        out how to keep this…”</p>
        <cite>— Tukwila SD (05/28/24)</cite>
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote class="quote">
        <p>“One parent wrote about their concerns that the district may cut AP and accelerated classes to help with budget issues… This 
        affects not only my high school plans, but my future college acceptance.”</p>
        <cite>— Moses Lake SD (05/23/24)</cite>
      </blockquote>
      <p><em>Key Concern</em>: Cutting graduation specialists or advanced courses reduces students’ college competitiveness and 
      scholarship opportunities.</p>

    <!-- Conclusion -->
    <section class="section" id="conclusion">
      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>Across districts of varying sizes, <strong>special education underfunding, expiring grants, and declining enrollment</strong> remain consistent pressure points leading to program cuts. Most districts strive to protect core academics first, leaving specialized programs—like arts, after‐school tutoring, advanced electives, and direct literacy interventions—at higher risk. Community members across districts frequently testify that these reductions have a human impact:</p>
      <blockquote class="quote">
        <p>“These cuts hurt… What you see as numbers on paper our students see as the people they rely on…”</p>
        <cite>— Tukwila SD (03/26/24)</cite>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Despite widespread frustration, district leaders plan for possible restoration if enrollment or state funding improves. Continued advocacy by stakeholders may help ensure these critical programs persist.</p>
